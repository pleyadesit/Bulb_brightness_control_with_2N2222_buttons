# Bulb_brightness_control_with_2N222_buttons

Brightness of a small 12V incandescent light bulb ðŸ’¡ controlled with an Arduino Nano clone and a 2N2222 NPN BJT transistor.
The brightness increases or decreases (+/- 25%) by pressing the buttons ðŸŸ¢ ðŸ”´ and its status is displayed on a 128x64 OLED screen.
The buttons connect the digital pins of the microcontroller to GND when they are pressed (I have activated by code the internal pull-up resistors of the two digital pins).
